                    Room Away From Home is a mobile application that enables the user to book a room designed to suit for COVID-19 isolation. The app features a listing page, self assessment tool, and a daily self checklist page to help the user gain better health.

                    Room Away From Home was made as a part of my <a class="text-link" href="https://www.sfu.ca/outlines.html?2021/spring/iat/334/d100"> User Interface Design </a> class in Simon Fraser University.

                <hr class="line-break">
                <p>
                    To first understand what we want to deliver for the user through our app, we created a questionnaire in Google Survey that consists of 9 multiple choice answers and received 59 responses from users within 48 hours. These questions were shaped to help us understand the relationship between users and their needs for quarantine purposes.

                </div>
                <p>
                    After the survey was done, we gathered the data and concluded that over 51% of the participants shared a bathroom with their household and 20% shared a bedroom, which prevents them from self isolating. Within those ideas, we acknowledge that amongst our user, it's hard for them to quarantine safely without affecting other household member. That's what push and inspired us to create Room Away From Home.

                <p>
                    I then created rough sketches of my idea how the screen architecture and wireframe would look like as a first step of the design process. My visual ideas was inspired by the application <a a class="text-link" href="https://www.airbnb.ca/">Airbnb</a> and since many health application may look too stiff, I took a more modern approach for the looks of the app.

                <p>
                   To show the interactive elements and provide important details, I built the medium fidelity wireframe through Figma. A special section that I initialize for this app is the Daily Self Assesment Tool to help the user mantain their health and able to get first-hand resources in the case of medical emergency.

                    I created a style guide for my team mates to maintain consistency while designing the prototype. We picked the color bold blue and yellow shown below to appear more professional and trustworthy. With our sans-serif fonts and circled-radius elements, it compliments the color and delivering the modern feels to the app.

                    Through multiple process of ideation, user testing and revising our app, we came up with Room Away From Home whcih is an app that helps the user to book a place that is designed for Quarantine purposes. It also comes with a check-up feature that tracks the health of the user daily while also giving out useful information and activities that the user could follow throughout the day.

                <hr class="line-break">
            
                <p>
                   This project is my first experience on learning to design an Interface. I realized to understand the user's need, we have to go through multiple process of testing, interviewing and reviewing back and forth. Amd by designing health-related application, I realized how important it is as a UI Designer to give a reliable information regarding the user's health.
